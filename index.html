                     Founder and owner of Return to Harmony, Angel Kametz, has been a massage therapist for nearly a decade.  Prior to that nursing was a way of life.  During that time she noticed how Western medicine did not always fully address all aspects of a patients care after an injury that left permanent damage.  She took her medical knowledge and her massage training to develop the Kametz Method&#8482; as a way to help the many people who needed a better solution than to live with pain or take pain relievers daily.
                </p>
                <p class="block">
                    This technique helps identify, treat, reduce the effects of , or even reverse damage caused by an injury, new or old. Using one or more protocols that were developed over a 10 year time frame, the method breaks down scar tissue that limits mobility, identifies muscle, tendon and ligament tears that cause tension and pain, and realigns the damaged fibers allowing people to build strength again eliminating the discomfort.  Treating the underlying problem is always the best solution, but most often the underlying problems are not properly identified.  The method can be used to treat but are not limited to neck, back, knee and rotator cuff injuries. Depending on the situation, treatment protocols usually run 6-12 weeks.
                </p>
                <p class="block">
                    Since the Kametz Method&#8482; was developed the business has grown exponentially. Those who have experienced what it can do have referred those they know who are in need and to this day thousands of those in our community as well as those in neighboring states have come to Draper to receive help from our therapists who are specifically trained in the Kametz Method&#8482;.
